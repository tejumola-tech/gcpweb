GCP Web Server Deployment with Terraform & Ansible

This project demonstrates deploying a web server on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management (Apache installation). It also explores GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

Key highlights:

Infrastructure: Google Compute Engine, VPC networks, External IP addresses

Configuration Management: Ansible for Apache deployment

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated deployment and debugging

Skills Learned: Handling credentials, secrets, variables, networking, and step-by-step troubleshooting

Through this project, I reinforced the principle: “No pain, no gain.” Persistence in debugging and iterative learning led to a fully working deployment pipeline.
